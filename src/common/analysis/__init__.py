# Minimalistic implementation of the analysis data layer for the GUI.

GUI TODO:
- changes (name, slots, result type) in workflow may break workflow that use it
- ? change slot and result types automaticaly or explicitely (that


TODO:  
- side_effect results - perform some actions for their sideefect, need a way to connect them to the result action instance
  that way result should have arbitrary number of parameters, but only the first is used (not good for a workflow with side effect but no true return value)
  
- introduce other special action instance SideEffect (works like result but is used for DFS,
  side effect always contains result as its input

3. GUI way to modify dataclasses and enums

3. test importing of user modules, better test of module functions
    - every action knows its __module__ that is full module name (not the alias from the import) 
    - must pass imports as a dictionalry to translate full module names to aliasses
    - implement full and iterative collection of used modules in definitions of the module
    #instance should  know its module path 
4. test_gui_api, etc.

1. Improved code generation:
    - modify _code methods to return (instance_name, format, list of instance to substitute into the format)
    - modify workspace code to dynamicaly expand format to obtain not extremaly long code representation:
        try to expand:
            - Value, dataclass instance, Tuple, List, GetAttribute ... should be the action property

4. Simplest evaluation support.
    - create Task DAG from the root analysis workflow.
    - process the Task DAG (serialy directly in Python)


    
      

6. Typechecking

- have common class for actions (current classes)
- other class (composition) for action instance
  ... no dynamical class creation
- How to deal with types, i.e. with dataclasses ... thats fine current spec have no support for inheritance
- Need typing extension to specify protocol "a dataclass with a key xyz"
- Can use dataclasses both as constructors and as type specification 
   (must set a _type attribute to the action wrapper function)

3. user modules: 
    - from analysis.workflow import *
        - decorators: workflow, analysis, Class, Enum
        - actions - basic, other in modules, lowercase
        - types - basic, other in modules, UpperCase 
    
    - from analysis import impl
        - @impl.action
        - impl.ActionBase
        - impl.AtomicAction
        - impl.DynamicAction  
    
    - Module
      [ Workflow, Class, Enum, Analysis]
    - Workflow
      [ ActionInstance ]
    - ActionInstance
      [ ActionBase ]
    code, workflow_dag, task_dag, scheduler


0: base actions overview
    data manipulation:
    - Value
    - Class ..
    - List
    - Dict
    - GetAttribute
    - GetListItem
    - GetDictItem
    
    ?? transpose - List[Class] -> Class[List] etc.
    ... sort of 'zip'
    
    expressions:
    - operators: +, -, *, /, %, **, @, 
    - math functions
    - not able to capture parenthesis
    
    file: 
    - load/save YAML/JSON + template substitution
    - serialization/deserialization of dataclasses and whole datatrees
    
    
    metaactions (actions taking a workflow as parameter):
    - foreach - apply a workflow with single slot to every item of a list 
    - while - takes the BODY workflow (automorphism) and PREDICATE (bool result)
            - expand BODY only if PREDICATE is true. 


5. Safe loading of sources in separate process.
    - Load and safe in separate process, catching the errors and prevent crashes and infinite loops.
    - Load the round trip source in the GUI/evaluation
